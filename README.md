Nekomo Coming Back Stronger!! A fork of Kuro No & Shiro (og source code) for watching anime. Just another anime scrapper, based on the shiro source code.. (Please, Do not share or make us popular!)

Dev info: The OG Dev is being quiet, and is no longer doing anything, and the app is being buggy, so I wanna take it in my own hands! 

Please note that we will be going private at some point..
