Nekomo Coming Back Stronger!! A fork of Kuro No & Shiro (og source code) for watching anime. Just another anime scrapper, based on the shiro source code.. (Please, Do not share or make us popular!)

Dev info: The OG Dev is being quiet, and is no longer doing anything, and the app is being buggy, so I wanna take it in my own hands! 

> **ALERT (Please Read)‚ö†Ô∏è**
> 
> Please be aware that this app is currently on hold and may not function properly. I am uncertain about its future. Progress is slow, if any progress is being made at all. I believe we need to update and clean/optimize the code to improve its performance, but there's a possibility that we may have to wait and start from scratch. There are no promises regarding its functionality, as this is a personal project. I will likely pause work on the project, and it may be a couple of years, maybe more, before any significant progress is made. Anyone is welcome to take over and contribute‚Äîwe need more developers.

Please note that we will be going private at some point..
